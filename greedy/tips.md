- For greedy problems, begin by picking the seemingly best/obvious/intuitive choice or method. Then, use properties of the problem to show that this seemingly best obvious choice is actually the best.

- The difficult step for greedy problems is showing that the current obvious choice is either the same/better quality than best overall choice. Usually done by making us of the properties of the current problem and using proof by contradiction combined with proof by exhaustion. 

-Can use two pointers, sliding window, hash map/array methods in greedy problems as well. Don't forget to look for applications of these methods even if the problem is greedy

-Common proof methods: 
Direct Proof, Proof by Contrapositive ("Invert, always invert" - Jacobi), Proof by Contradiction, Proof by Exhaustion, Inductive Proof, Proof by Construction, Proof by Counterexample
