- There are various clues to help determine if a problem is a bit problem. One way is seeing if the constraints mention a 32 bit integer or restrict the bits on the integer. Another way is a mention of duplicate numbers, missing number, unique numbers, etc. 

- Whenever we can formulate a problem as the cancelling out/inverting of bits, XOR can be used. ex: Missing number, Single Number.
