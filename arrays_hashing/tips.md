### Tips:
-Key point about using hash sets/ hash maps is to cut down on excessive for loops. Since hash maps allow constant time lookup and edits, can completely eliminate some for loops

-Dictionaries in python also hold a seperate array for all the keys in the Hash Table, so iteration over all keys/values occur in O(n) time, where n is the number of keys inserted into the Dictionary
