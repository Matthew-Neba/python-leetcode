- Backtracking is essentially a smarter brute-force with early exits. Use it when the brute force solution would try all possibilities â€” but you can prune bad paths early

-Backtracking is a last resort apart from unoptimzied brute force. Use it when no other better soluution exists (DP, Greedy, Mathematical, etc.)

- Key tip is to use a for/while loop to manage the decision making part of each recursion call in backtracking when possible. No need for very complex recursion logic.
