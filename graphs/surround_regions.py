# Key to this prblem is realizing that using recursive dfs and returning values is unreliable in graphs due to cycles, so we should use marking dfs instead instead. We realize that any "O"'s connected to the border cannot be flipped.  This leads me to realize that rather than checking each cell individually, we can invert the problem. This inversion pattern seems to be common with graphing problems. ex: pacific atlantic ocean, islands and treasure
#   1. Start DFS/BFS from all border 'O's and mark all reachable cells.  
#   2. These marked cells are safe and wonâ€™t be flipped.  
#   3. Finally, flip all unmarked 'O's, which are truly surrounded.
